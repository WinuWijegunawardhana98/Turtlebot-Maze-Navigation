# Turtlebot-Maze-Navigation
This ROS Kinetic project programs TurtleBot3 to autonomously navigate mazes using LIDAR, detect open slits with mock logic, select paths, and park in a designated zone. It combines Python-based control scripts for simulation (Gazebo) and hardware deployment, supporting modular and scalable tasks.
